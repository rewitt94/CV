## How I Got Here

Short-answer: Luck.

Long-answer: I studied Maths at university because I was good at it. I graduated unsure what to do with my life (and with bad backpain). I worked in Tenerife because it was hot. In the autumn I moved to back to Spain (this time Madrid) to look for a job, but quickly decided it didn't want to be a teacher/waiter forever. Now I've just finished a CIMA Certificate in Business Accounting because it seemed logical. However, somewhere along the line I started getting distracted by programming (initially solving these  https://projecteuler.net/ with Python). Now I know it's what I want to do! I am really EXCITED to do something that I enjoy day-to-day!
