## Skills

#### Logic

I have always had strong logic. Not to brag, but this is a CV. In school I received UK Mathematical Trust Challenge (3 x Gold), British Physics AS Olympiad (Silver), Cambridge Chemistry Challenge (Silver). I also won the 6th form Physics Prize. Since discovering programmming problem-solving is more satisfying than ever.

#### Communication Skills

All my work-experience has been in Teaching (TEFL) and Hospitality. Controlling a room of twenty-plus students in a second language requires public speaking skills. My favourite part of hospitality was customer service (small talk) - me and a colleage once received a €400 tip.
