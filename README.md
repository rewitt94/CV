## Ricky Hewitt

Hello prospective employers! I'm a Junior Developer.

## Skills

#### Logic

I have always displayed logical skills. In school I received UK Mathematical Trust Challenge (3 x Gold), British Physics AS Olympiad (Silver), Cambridge Chemistry Challenge (Silver). I also won the 6th form Physics Prize. Since discovering programmming problem-solving is more satisfying than ever. Now I can solve problems to build things (how cool is that)!

#### Communication Skills

All my work-experience has been in Teaching and Hospitality. My favourite part of hospitality was customer service.

## How I Got Here

Short-answer: Luck.

Long-answer: I studied Maths at university because I was good at it. I graduated unsure what to do with my life (and with bad backpain). I worked in Tenerife because it was hot. In the autumn I moved to back to Spain (this time Madrid) to look for a job, but quickly decided it didn't want to be a teacher/waiter forever. Now I've just finished a CIMA Certificate in Business Accounting because it seemed logical. However, somewhere along the line I started getting distracted by programming (initially solving these  https://projecteuler.net/ with Python). Now I know it's what I want to do! I am really EXCITED to do something that I enjoy day-to-day!!!
