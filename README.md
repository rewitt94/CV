## Skills

#### Logic

In school I received UK Mathematical Trust Challenge (3 x Gold), British Physics AS Olympiad (Silver), Cambridge Chemistry Challenge (Silver). I also won the 6th form Physics Prize. Since discovering programmming problem-solving is more satisfying than ever.

#### Communication Skills

All my work-experience has been in Teaching (TEFL) and Hospitality. Controlling a room of up to twenty-five students in a second language requires public speaking skills. My favourite part of hospitality was customer service (small talk) - me and a colleage once received a €400 tip. At Makers Academy no code is written alone (except on weekends). I enjoy both pairing and mobing. Colborating to the same code base is unlike any prior teamwork I've done and a skill I'm definitely learning here at Makers Academy.
